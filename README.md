## **Motivation**

From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by finance—how economies function, the strategies
behind saving and investing, and the factors that influence financial decision-making. 
Growing up in a low-income household, I noticed a significant lack of financial literacy 
among those around me. With limited formal education and financial literacy, many individuals
managed money reactively, spending without budgets or saving plans. However, while accompanying
my mother, a hardworking housekeeper, to the homes of wealthy families. There, I witnessed
a stark contrast: these individuals demonstrated disciplined financial behaviors, carefully
budgeting and allocating their resources. Observing this inspired me to explore the role 
education plays in financial decision-making. I became curious about whether education equips
individuals with better tools and knowledge to manage money effectively. This curiosity
laid the foundation for my capstone project. My research examines the impact of education
on financial decision-making, with a focus on whether more educated individuals have higher 
incomes and overall better financial behaviors. Through this project, I aim to explore the
intersection of education, financial literacy, and economic outcomes, while leveraging my 
skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  

## **Data Questions**

1. How do different education levels correlate with **income**?  
2. Do households with higher education demonstrate more **prudent spending habits**?  
3. Do higher-educated households derive a greater portion of income from **passive investments**?  
4. Are higher-educated households more likely to have **retirement accounts**? 

## **Data Source**

The project uses the following datasets:

1. **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics – Consumer Expenditure Survey**:  
   - **FMLI**: Provides household demographic and income data.  
   - **MTBI**: Includes detailed houshold spending patterns by category.
   - **Website**: [2023 BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cex/pumd_data.htm#csv)

## **Challenges**

- **Data Interpretation**: Many fields use coded values requiring manual decoding.  
- **Volume of Data**: The datasets contain over **4,000 rows** across multiple quarters.  
- **Ambiguous Descriptions**: Some variables lack clear definitions.  
- **Population Variances**: Accounting for differences across regions and education levels.

- Investigate spending habits and **investment behaviors** of households.  
- Present findings through clear **visualizations** and **interactive dashboards**.
