## **Motivation**

Growing up, I was always fascinated by personal finance—saving, investing, and planning for the future.
When I turned 18, I opened a brokerage account and started contributing to a Roth IRA.
It was exciting to take those first steps, but when I shared what I was learning with my
family, I realized something important: there was a real gap in financial literacy.
My parents, who didn’t have the chance for much formal education, were unfamiliar with tools like Roth IRAs,
while my higher-educated relatives seemed much more comfortable with concepts like investing and saving.

This made me curious about the connection between education and the financial decisions
people make. My degree in Financial Technology introduced me to the world of financial systems,
but it was at the Nashville Software School where I really developed the skills to analyze data and uncover insights.

This capstone project brings it all together—my personal experiences,my technical training,
and my desire to understand how education shapes financial behaviors and, ultimately, quality of life.

## **Data Questions**

1. How do different education levels correlate with **income**?  
2. Do households with higher education demonstrate more **prudent spending habits**?  
3. Do higher-educated households derive a greater portion of income from **passive investments**?  
4. Are higher-educated households more likely to have **retirement accounts**? 

## **Data Source**

The project uses the following datasets:

1. **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics – Consumer Expenditure Survey**:  
   - **FMLI**: Provides household demographic and income data.  
   - **MTBI**: Includes detailed houshold spending patterns by category.
   - **Website**: [2023 BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cex/pumd_data.htm#csv)

## **Challenges**

- **Data Interpretation**: Many fields use coded values requiring manual decoding.  
- **Volume of Data**: The datasets contain over **4,000 rows** across multiple quarters.  
- **Ambiguous Descriptions**: Some variables lack clear definitions.  
- **Population Variances**: Accounting for differences across regions and education levels.

## **Project Goals**

- Analyze the correlation between **education levels** and household income.  
- Investigate spending habits and **investment behaviors** of households.  
- Present findings through clear **visualizations** and **interactive dashboards**.


## **Tools and Technologies**

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards  
- **Excel**: Quick data exploration and summary visuals  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Step-by-step data analysis workflow
