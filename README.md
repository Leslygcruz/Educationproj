## **Motivation**

Growing up, I was fascinated with personal finance—saving, investing, and planning for the future. At 18, I opened a brokerage account and began contributing to a **Roth IRA**, investing in ETFs and stocks. Sharing these experiences with my family revealed a significant gap in **financial literacy**:  

- My parents, with limited formal education, were unfamiliar with investment vehicles.  
- Even some higher-educated relatives lacked knowledge about **Roth IRAs** and passive investing.  

This sparked my curiosity about the connection between **education** and **financial decision-making**, inspiring this capstone project.
